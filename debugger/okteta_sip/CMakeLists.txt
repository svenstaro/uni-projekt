# The .sip files being built here are generated using MetaSIP from
# http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/hg/metasip. This is a relatively new tool
# and is typically not packaged by distros. A summary of the steps needed to
# get it working are at http://python.6.n6.nabble.com/ANN-MetaSIP-v1-0-Released-tp4715818p4991287.html.
# The result is a MetaSIP .msp project file, from which MetaSIP's CLI
# can be used to generate the .sip files. The MetaSIP GUI is used to create
# the .msp file:
#
# msip <whatever>.msp
#
# To recreate the .sip files, cd to this directory and then:
#
# msip -g . <whatever>.msp
#
# For now, the .msp file and the .sip files are checked into this directory,
# and the <whatever> subdirectory respectively.
