7.5 Checklist for the Design of an Opcode.

Designing an opcode starts with asking a number of questions. The answers are found in the specification of
the opcode. The answers identify the outputs that need to be set other than their default values. While the
instructions are quite different, the questions are always the same:

1. What operation shall the ALU perform? Set ALU_OP and Q_WE_F accordingly.
2. Is a destination register or destination register pair used? If so, set DDDDD (and WE_D if written).
3. Is a second register or register pair involved? If so, set RRRRR.
4. Does the opcode access the memory? If so, set AMOD, PMS, RSEL, RD_M, WE_M, and
WE_XYZS accordingly.
5. Is an immediate or implied operand used? If so, set IMM and RSEL.
6. Is the program counter modified (other than incrementing it)? If so, set PC_OP and SKIP.
7. Is a bit number specified in the opcode ? If so, set BIT.
8. Are instructions skipped? If so, set SKIP.
